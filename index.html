              <p class="lead pt-5">Godzilla (ゴジラ Gojira) is a daikaiju who first appeared in the 1954 Toho film Godzilla.<br> This Godzilla was a bizarre new species spawned by the dumping of nuclear waste in Tokyo Bay in the 1950s, with the capacity to adapt to any situation by spontaneously mutating his own DNA. Toho introduced a new continuity the following year with the GODZILLA anime trilogy, in which Godzilla successfully drove humanity from the Earth in 2048 and reshaped the planet in his own image over the next 20,000 years. When refugees from the Aratrum returned to reclaim the planet, they were faced with a Godzilla that had continuously grown and evolved to reach a height of over 300 meters. Most recently, Godzilla appeared in the 2023 film Godzilla Minus One, yet another reboot.</p>

King Ghidorah was teased in the second entry of the GODZILLA anime trilogy, and appeared as the main antagonist in the trilogy's final entry, GODZILLA: The Planet Eater. King Ghidorah was also teased through a cave painting in the second film in the Monsterverse, Kong: Skull Island, and went on to star as the villain of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the sequel to Legendary Pictures' Godzilla. One of Ghidorah's skulls was carried over into the next Monsterverse film, Godzilla vs. Kong, in which it was used as part of Mechagodzilla's control system.</p>

Monsterverse after appearing in the film Kong: Skull Island. In this continuity, Kong witnessed the brutal death of his parents at the hands of the Skullcrawlers shortly after his birth, leading him to become the self-appointed guardian of Skull Island. He reappears in the film's 2021 sequel Godzilla vs. Kong, in which he initially enters into conflict with Godzilla but eventually sides with him to destroy the Apex Cybernetics-constructed anti-Titan weapon Mechagodzilla.</p>
